Agrotechnology: Live Potato Leaf Disease Detect Section

We all know that, Bangladesh is a agricultural blessed country and has lot of natural adavntages for producing corps! Rice and Potatos are the major corps that are mostly consume in Bangladesh! According to FAO ( Food and Agricultural Organization), almost 25% potatoes are lost because of not taking necessary step , infect of pest. In this section, We built a system based on ML and Deep Learning technique and deployed into the streamlit which is a data science platform to deploy the trained model to use it in real time. And Finally we integrated this app with our mother application called "HuoAgroFarm". If you want to know more details about this potato leaf disease detection system,

# Potato Disease Detection UI: 
This is the User Interface of Potato Leaf Disease Detection where We can insert an image to detect the disease
