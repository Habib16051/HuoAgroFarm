# What we Offers:

We are commited to make a significant roles to our Bangladeshi Farmers! We aim to make such a platform where Our farmers, young generation will be more intersted to use modern technology and tools in the sector of agriculture. We will provide informations, resources, tools and will share our vision to inspire our people! We have god gifted weather, climate  and fertile land which is very preferable to grow agricultural products like Rice, Wheat, Potatoes and Vegetables! So we will keep update and contribute to make our platform in another level. Stay Tune!

# Features

1. Agrotechnology: Live Potato Leaf Disease Detect Section

We all know that, Bangladesh is a agricultural blessed country and has lot of natural adavntages for producing corps! Rice and Potatos are the major corps that are mostly consume in Bangladesh! According to FAO ( Food and Agricultural Organization), almost 25% potatoes are lost because of not taking necessary step , infect of pest. In this section, We built a system based on ML and Deep Learning technique and deployed into the streamlit which is a data science platform to deploy the trained model to use it in real time. And Finally we integrated this app with our mother application called "HuoAgroFarm". If you want to know more details about this potato leaf disease detection system,

# Potato Disease Detection UI: 
This is the User Interface of Potato Leaf Disease Detection where We can insert an image to detect the disease
